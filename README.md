ONLINE QUIZ WEBSITE

Since technology has an important effect on how we communicate and learn in the modern world, having access to digital resources is more essential than ever. Our online quiz website aims to give students an enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing way to advance their HTML skills. We provide a place where users can improve their HTML knowledge and test their skills by combining interactive learning with modern looks.
This website is more concerned with appearance and design than with functionality for now. The website is created with HTML and CSS, it has a clean, modern style that makes navigation easy through three main sections: Home, Play, and About Us. The Quiz section is the most important part of the website, where users can try different type and different levels of quizzes. It provides a fun and interactive environment for users to test and improve their knowledge of HTML-related topics. The Home section welcomes users with a neat and inviting design, while the About Us page explains the project’s vision and the purpose of the website. And the website aims to create an attractive and engaging platform for users to improve their knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We want to offer an interactive place where the users can test and grow their understanding of about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
While our current focus is on making the website look good, we also plan to build a solid foundation for future updates that will make the platform fully interactive and functional. Using this approach allows us to plan for the development of a fully functional and interactive platform later on while also focusing on improving the user experience now. 
The project is important since it helps students’ study by using modern technology. Our platform aims to give students a simple and visually appealing tool to improve their HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills and understanding as the use of technology keeps on developing. We also want to make learning more efficient and enjoyable. By focusing on design and using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project also provides us with a chance to show our abilities in web development and web design.
